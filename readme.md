# Minimalistic base theme

This theme is used for Minimalistic-based projects as a boilerplate. Its structure or functionality 
is not a requirement and you can easily edit it to fit project needs. Just keep in mind that 
the idea behind it is to create a general template that can be easily understood and in case 
the project developer is unavailable, you or another dev can continue work without too much effort.
